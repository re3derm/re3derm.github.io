              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Project history</strong><br />

                Technology has been developed for after-burn treatment by Dr. Gavriluk, Founding Head of the Laboratory of Cells and Tissues at Biophysics Institute (The Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow region, Russia). Preliminary trials include various cases at Russian major burn and surgery medical centers and hospitals, field usage by soldiers during military conflicts in Chechnya (Russia) and other Russian army divisions, regeneration complex has been successfully used after catastrophes in coal mining etc. Re3derm is cosmetic application of medicine technology.</p>

                - 1st award at European Hopes for Innovation on InnovAct (France), sponsored by Eureka<br />

                - 2nd prize at &ldquo;Business of Innovation Technologies&rdquo; (BIT), Russia<br />

                - Scientific and medical awards: Russian Government Award, Russian Award &ldquo;National Heritage&rdquo;, National endowment and other international and Russian awards</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Product</strong> <strong>features</strong><br />

                The main feature of Re3Derm is a skin structure regeneration effect due to launching of regeneration trigger mechanism (initiative-chain reaction), biophysical influence on skin cells by active polysaccharides groups, initiating strengthening of microcapillaries, young skin cells growth and riping skin cells functional activation. It leads not only to short term improvement of surface skin, but also to fundamental improvements of skin structure and restoration of active cell processes in a healthy and natural manner.</p>

              <p><strong>Application in cosmetology</strong><br />

                As it is independent treatment (mask procedures) and in combination with various skin-damaging cosmetic and rejuvenation procedures:</p>

              <p>- In Skin Rejuvenation (resurfacing for non-cancerous skin conditions): Dermabrasion and Microdermabrasion [MDA], Chemical Peel, Laser Ablation/resurfacing;<br />

                - In Skin Rejuvenation (non-surgical treatment modalities for facial wrinkles): Dermal Fillers [Injectables], Non-Ablative Energy Sources &ndash; laser systems, radio frequency devices, photodynamic therapy, other-LED photomodulation;<br />

                - The final option in facial rejuvenation: cosmetic surgery.</p>

              <p><strong>Composition of Re3Derm</strong><br />

                Re3Derm has a patented formula &ndash; unique mix of water soluble plant polysaccharide complexes, including such components as hydroxyethylcellulose (water soluble cellulose derivatives), carrageenan and ascophyllum nodosum, pectin, glucono delta-lactone, propylene glycol, water, glycerin and other components.<br />

                The mixture is a sophisticated formula, and it was developed after more than 200 experiments. The result is a unique physicochemical structure and configuration of active groups, that gives an opportunity to influence tissues in a different propitious directions at the same time. Unique effects are achieved not by each ingredient alone, but by their mixture, where separated polymers interact in the certain manner by flexible involvement and interactions.<br />

                The size of 20-25% of gel&rsquo;s molecules is approximately 5-20 nm, and this allows molecules of gel to reach epidermis basal layer. Bigger sized molecules stay on the skin&rsquo;s surface and create the film &ndash; &lsquo;second skin&rsquo; with its all beneficial effects.<br />

                Re3Derm doesn&rsquo;t contain any components of animal or synthetic origin. The gel does not contain proteins as well, so risk of allergic reactions development is minimal.</p>

              <p><strong>Action mechanism</strong></p>

              <p> - First, there is significant activation of tissues regenerative function (by creation of natural microenvironment for skin cells initiating their active proliferation) with threefold epithelialization acceleration. Second, Re3derm stimulates large cells mobility and more steady fibroblasts proliferation. The gel intensifies cells migration inside the wound and on its surface and promotes even and smooth tissues appearance. Third, the organism perceives the gel as natural, allied substance. It let block activating of &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; processes for urgent covering of affected surfaces, leading to scars formation.<br />

                - Polysaccharides of gel create differently charged ions, binding with harmful proteins, enzymes, toxins, bacterium, etc. and neutralize them.<br />

                - Re3derm components interact with damaged skin&rsquo;s proteins and form protecting film &ndash; an ideal environment for cells proliferation and skin&rsquo;s regeneration. The film supports physiological wound aquation, promotes bioregalators diffusion and toxins binding, prevents skin&rsquo;s contamination and tissues xeransis. Preclinical trials results that Re3derm blocks inflammation and initiates regeneration: in skin films there was regenerative cytogram type in comparison with other products where degenerative-phlogistic cytogram type was observed. With Re3derm regeneration was not just faster, but also more full: fibroblasts proliferation was more even and in tissues print young squamous epithelium cells were seen. Absence of eosinophilic infiltration shows the absence of allergic reaction.<br />

                - Re3Derm has high permeability and due to this effect it strengthens any cosmetic products effects. It is achieved by differently charged gel particles, gravitating by skin components that penetrate to lower skin layers.</p>
